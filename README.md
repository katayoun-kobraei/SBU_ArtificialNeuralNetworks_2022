# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Course - Shahid Beheshti University

## Overview

This repository contains my projects and assignments from the **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) - 2022** course as part of the Bachelor's programs at **Shahid Beheshti University**. The course provided in-depth knowledge of various neural network architectures and techniques, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical implementations using libraries like **PyTorch**.

The goal of this course was to equip us with a solid foundation in neural networks, including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and modern architectures such as **EfficientNet**, **ResNet**, and **variational autoencoders**. The course emphasized practical applications through assignments involving popular datasets like **Fashion MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, **Intel Image Classification**, and more.

Below is an overview of the five assignments, each focusing on a different aspect of neural networks, with theoretical and implementation-based exercises.
